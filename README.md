# JavaScript Arithmetic Operations

This is a simple JavaScript program that demonstrates basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

## Description

The program declares two variables, `num1` and `num2`, assigns them the values `15` and `8`, respectively, and performs the following operations:

1. Addition (`+`)
2. Subtraction (`-`)
3. Multiplication (`*`)
4. Division (`/`)
5. Modulus (`%`)

It stores the results of each operation in separate variables and prints the results to the console in a clear format.

## Operations

For `num1 = 15` and `num2 = 8`, the following operations are performed:

- Addition: `15 + 8 = 23`
- Subtraction: `15 - 8 = 7`
- Multiplication: `15 * 8 = 120`
- Division: `15 / 8 = 1.875`
- Modulus: `15 % 8 = 7`
